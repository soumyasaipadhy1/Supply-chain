## ðŸ“ŒProject- Optimization in Supply Chain Management
#### -Client: A Pallet Manufacturing Company
#### -Business Problem:
- Number of pallets to be stored in inventory for shipping to different customers is very volatile leading to understocking or overstocking. Understocking is leading to not honoring client requirements and overstocking is leading to inventory cost.
#### -Business Solution:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: - The datasets must be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that they are consistent and complete. This may involve removing outliers, converting data to a common format, and filling in missing values.
- Data analysis: - The data can then be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in supply chain management.
#### -Technology Stack:
- **Database:** Excel, MySQL
- **BI Tools used:** Microsoft Power Bi, Tableau and Google Looker Studio
- **Deployment Tools:** Power Bi and Tableau
#### -Business Benefits:
- Reduce the volatility by at least 90%
- Achieve a cost saving of at least $1M
